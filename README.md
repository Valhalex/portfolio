## Description

This site is a home page for my portfolio. It is the first react project I have created, as well as the first iteration of a live portfolio I have made. It will show an updated list of projects I have completed or am currently working on, as well as links to learn more about me, gain access to my resume, and a way to contact me.

## Technologies

This site was created with create-react-app, and makes use of SCSS as well as a single HTML page.
